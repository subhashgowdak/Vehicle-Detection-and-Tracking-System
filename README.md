## Vehicle Detection and Tracking System

A Python-based **real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and counting system** built using YOLO, OpenCV, and video analytics.
This project demonstrates how computer vision can be used for traffic monitoring, automated counting, and basic surveillance tasks.

## 🚗 Project Overview  
This system uses the **YOLO (Ultralytics)** object detection model to identify vehicles in a video stream, track their movement, and count how many of them cross a predefined line.

**Core functionalities include:**  
- Detecting vehicles from a video file  
- Tracking objects frame by frame  
- Counting vehicles when they cross a specified line  
- Displaying real-time bounding boxes and labels  
- Showing live count of each vehicle class (e.g., car, bus, truck, bike)
